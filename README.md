# ðŸ”¢ 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

This project implements a **4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** using **Logisim**.  
The ALU performs a variety of arithmetic and logical operations on two 4-bit inputs.  
It is designed using **multiplexers** for operation selection, making it about **20% more efficient** than a conventional design.
