# ⚡ 4-Bit ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)

## 🔎 Overview

This project implements a **4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** with a design optimized for **speed and simplicity**. Unlike traditional ALUs that focus on many operations, this design focuses on a **core operation set** while achieving **higher efficiency and reduced delay**.

The ALU is one of the most important building blocks in computer architecture. This project demonstrates how an efficient ALU can be implemented using **multiplexers and basic logic gates**, making it both practical and educational.

## ✨ Features

* **4-bit inputs (A, B)**
* Arithmetic operations: **Addition, Subtraction**
* Logical operations: **AND, OR, XOR, NOT**
* **Multiplexer-based selection** for faster execution
* **Reduced propagation delay** compared to standard designs
* **Modular design** → easily scalable to 8-bit or 16-bit

## ⚖️ Comparison with Other ALUs

| Factor                   | Traditional ALU                      | This 4-Bit ALU                                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Speed**                | Moderate (depends on gate depth)     | Faster (optimized multiplexer design reduces delay)         |
| **Number of Operations** | More (shift, multiply, divide, etc.) | Core set only (Add, Sub, AND, OR, XOR, NOT) → simple & fast |
| **Resource Usage**       | Higher (complex logic)               | Lower (efficient gate usage)                                |
| **Scalability**          | Often requires redesign              | Modular, easy to extend                                     |
| **Ease of Learning**     | Complex for beginners                | Easy to understand and implement                            |

**Summary:**

* Traditional ALUs = **versatility** (many functions, but slower & complex).
* This ALU = **efficiency** (fewer functions, but faster & lightweight).
